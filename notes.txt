java Script is  alone itself is not capable or is not used for backend as it lacks some capabilities 
So what Ryan dalph did was that he used the V8 engine of chrome browser (which carries out evrything) and did some experiments with it 
Now the v8 engine was made in c++ so  the js which we write cannot be used directly for our operations
So he created a  type of wrapper around the v8 engine which was of Js language
So now the js which we write can be used for backend operations and it can be used for creating and this enviornment  is called  js run time enviornment or node js
So now the js which we write can be used for backend operations......................


npm  is like app store or playstore  from where we can borrow code in form of packages
npm init -> package.json -> lekha johoka of the project ( every detail)

to use any module just use the require function 
eg  cosnt fs = require ('fs')
now  we can use all the things which fs module does or have 


note callback in js always means a  function;
eg  fs.readFile('file.txt', function(err, data){})  here the function is callback


HTTPP : 
There are some rules and regulations which are meant to be followed to do anyhting on the internet  that are set by creators of the internet
And to make sure that you follow these ruels they are preinstalled in your  pc operating system 

And http is the rule that needs to follow while sending and receiving data


npm - node package manager

**** jo  node js me preinstalled ata h ussy hum kehtey h module****
**** jo hum npm se intall krte h ussy boltey h package****

To install anything from npm we need to just use ::: npm i package_name
uninstall package -> npm uninstall package_name

installing the right version ----- nmp i package_name@version

NODE MODULE folder - >  eg when we are installing a package (accessbilty )there are chaneces that this package have some dependencies which are needed by this package therefore these dependecies or packages will be present  in the node module folder; 

dependecies :  packages and packages ki dependecies
devDependencies : aese packages jo sirf development tk kaam aye aur once after the deployment are of no use 


npm start  vs npm runs start 
see not just about start command but ----- see when we install node js , thi node js just installs some commmands  in our OS table that can be detected easily by the pc , so we dont need to use the run command
But for example we are creating our own commmands we need to  use  run satatement as to tell  system to look in Script for such kind of commmands
